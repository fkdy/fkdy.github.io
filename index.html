	<h2 class="western">Biography</h2>
	<p>Hang Zhang is currently a second year M.Phil. student in
	Department of Computer Science &amp; Engineering at The Chinese
	University of Hong Kong (CUHK). He is working closely with Prof.
	<a href="http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Efyyoung/" target="“blank”">Evangeline
	F. Y. Young</a>. Before that, he received the B. Eng degree from
	<a href="http://www.scu.edu.cn/en/" target="“blank”">Sichuan
	University (SCU)</a> in 2015, where he worked with Prof. <a href="http://www.scu.edu.cn/eie/faculty/webinfo/2010/10/1286178494662243.htm" target="“blank”">Xiaohai
	He</a>.</p>
	<p>He started his research in VLSI CAD/EDA in August 2015. During
	his M.Phil. study, his research interests mainly lie in machine
	learning, numerical optimization and combinatorial optimization with
	their application in VLSI CAD/EDA. Here is the research summary
	(titled <a href="https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/%7Ehzhang/others/research_summary.pdf" target="“blank”"><i>Learning
	Models for Lithography Process Induced Manufacturing Problems and
	Beyond</i></a> ) for his M.Phil. study. 
	</p>
	<p>For his Ph.D. study, he is mostly interested in two major
	directions: 1) Develop algorithms and theories in artificial
	intelligence and machine learning especially Bayesian programming
	and deep learning models with their applications in robotics,
	computer vision, and quantitative analysis for finance; 2) Develop
	efficient computing systems or architectures, such as FPGAs,
	highly-tunable ASICs, for large-scale machine learning applications
	and high-frequency trading systems. 
	</p>
	<p><font color="#ff0000">I am looking for self-motivated
	undergraduate students (any schools) to work on interesting
	topics/projects related to deep learning, statistical learning, and
	electronic design automation. If you are interested, please drop me
	an email with your CV. </font>
